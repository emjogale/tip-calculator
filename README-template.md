## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that you should use the correct html element for the correct reason - for example I first had the tip amount and the total areas as inputs - I thought this would be a good idea as I could then have a placeholder and for a few other reasons that seem to me to be valid at the time - but then the problems starting arising and it was kindly pointed out to me that as they aren't input areas they shouldn't use an input tag. Wise advice.
I also had a go at using CSS custom properties with the colours which seems to work well and makes for easy adjustments as and when desired/required.
I also learnt the difference betweeen 0 == '0' and 0 === '0', as in the first one will equate to true, whereas the strict equals won't - this was important when checking if the number of people was 0 or not.
